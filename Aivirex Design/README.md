> This project uses React for frontend and firebase for the backend

## Notes:
The api we used is githubapi which is authorised with my key.
The github api may not work because the key was invalidated. 

You need to assign your own keys to make the github api work.
If you would like to change this change the firebase keys and then change the github keys to yours.
and that's the major thing to change in this project.
